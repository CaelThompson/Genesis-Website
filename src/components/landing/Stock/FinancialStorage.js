<p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">As CFO, I want to echo our CEO's sentiments about the need for strategic growth. This year presented several margin pressures, leading to a 2.4% year-over-year decrease in profit margins, now at 13.3%, and a dip in annual revenue to approximately $14.9 billion USD.

        <p style=";; margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>[Brian Matthews] </strong><br>Balancing growth investments with financial stability is crucial. We are prioritizing strategic investments that offer high returns, such as advancements in technology and infrastructure that directly improve operational efficiencies and product offerings. At the same time, we maintain a disciplined approach in our financial management, ensuring liquidity and stable cash flow through careful budget allocation and actively monitoring financial metrics to avoid unnecessary expenditures. </p>
