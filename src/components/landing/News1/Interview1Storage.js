  Brian, thanks for taking the time today. From the finance side, we’ve seen the medical device vertical contributing more to our opportunity pipeline—but also more complexity. What’s fueling our shift in that space?</p>

  <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>[Brian Matthews]</strong><br>
  Thanks, Natalie. The healthcare sector’s need for high-precision, regulation-compliant components—especially those adhering to FDA and EU-MDR standards—perfectly aligns with our core strengths in multi-axis machining, documentation accuracy, and precision manufacturing. Our background in aerospace and defense gave us the discipline needed to meet rigorous specs, and that’s opened doors in medtech. But it’s a complex transition. These OEMs expect rapid iterations, deep traceability, and upfront engagement during the design and compliance stages. That’s been pushing us to adapt our internal workflows.</p>

  <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>[Natalie Sharpe]</strong><br>
  So we’re not just plugging into existing workflows—we’re reshaping ours?</p>

  <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>[Brian Matthews]</strong><br>
  Exactly. Unlike our standard engagements in automotive or industrial sectors, medical device OEMs loop us in earlier—during design, validation, and even regulatory prep. That’s exciting, but also demanding. Our teams are now managing tighter timelines and additional documentation requirements across multiple regions. We’ve seen real strain on engineering bandwidth and our prototyping queue.</p>

  <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>[Natalie Sharpe]</strong><br>
  From your seat on the finance side, how is that impacting customer relationships?</p>

  <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>[Brian Matthews]</strong><br>
  It’s a tightrope. We’ve built trust through transparency—we don’t overpromise—but it’s tough when a project slips because machine time or compliance reviews hit a bottleneck. We had a prototype request for a surgical enclosure get delayed last quarter simply due to tooling backlog. While we retained the customer, it delayed their product validation timeline. We're not losing contracts, but we’re definitely operating at capacity in some key areas.</p>

  <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>[Natalie Sharpe]</strong><br>
  What’s being done to address that strain?</p>

  <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>[Brian Matthews]</strong><br>
  We’re coordinating with Jan Wilcox’s manufacturing team and Fred Reed’s product development group to prioritize high-value medical projects. But to grow sustainably, we’ll need capital investment—especially in cleanroom-rated equipment, expanded QA infrastructure, and potentially additional regulatory training for engineering staff. We’re also exploring partnerships with firms that can augment our validation testing capabilities without diluting quality.</p>

  <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>[Natalie Sharpe]</strong><br>
  It sounds like the opportunity is real—but it comes with no shortcuts. Where do you see the most promising growth?</p>

  <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>[Brian Matthews]</strong><br>
  Surgical robotics and smart implantables are two spaces we’re well-positioned to support. These products demand the kind of custom-engineered precision that Genesis is built on. But we need to earn our way in by proving we can hit specs consistently and manage compliance efficiently. If we do that, we’ll be a preferred Tier 2 partner for multiple OEMs in that space.</p>

  <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>[Natalie Sharpe]</strong><br>
  That’s critical context as we think about budgeting and capital priorities. Thanks for the insight, Brian.</p>

  <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>[Brian Matthews]</strong><br>
  Glad to contribute, Natalie. Our foundation is solid—we just need to keep aligning execution with opportunity and stay honest about where we need to grow.</p>`

  Victor, Genesis is well known for hands-on collaboration with customers. What’s driving this new focus on simulation?</p>

  <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>[Victor Viola]</strong><br>
  Our strength has always been deep design-for-manufacturing support and real-world validation. That’s not going away. But the complexity and pace of our customers’ industries—especially medical—require us to bring smarter tools to the front end. Through our discussions with Siemens DISW, we’re evaluating how simulation can help us scope requirements faster and reduce risk before a part ever hits the shop floor.</p>

  <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>[Kavita Menon]</strong><br>
  So this isn’t about replacing your existing workflows—it’s about enhancing them?</p>

  <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>[Victor Viola]</strong><br>
  Exactly. We’re not replacing physical testing or quality gates. We’re supplementing them. Think of it as building customer confidence earlier. If we can simulate thermal behavior, stress points, or process tolerances during early discussions, we’re giving customers more visibility into how their designs will perform—and how Genesis will manufacture them. That builds alignment before quoting or tooling ever begins.</p>

  <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>[Kavita Menon]</strong><br>
  How far along is Genesis in this effort?</p>

  <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>[Victor Viola]</strong><br>
  We’re in the early adoption phase. Our engineers are partnering with Siemens to test modeling tools and understand how they integrate with our existing design support process. It’s less about scaling up instantly and more about making smart moves that match our customers’ needs and our internal readiness.</p>

  <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>[Kavita Menon]</strong><br>
  Would this shift affect internal collaboration?</p>

  <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>[Victor Viola]</strong><br>
  Absolutely. One of the most exciting parts of this is the potential for simulation to act as a bridge between sales, design, and operations. Digital modeling can help clarify tolerances, manufacturability, and tradeoffs early, reducing surprises downstream. That kind of visibility makes everyone’s job easier and aligns with our culture of precision and responsiveness.</p>

  <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>[Kavita Menon]</strong><br>
  You also mentioned AI in passing—how does that tie into Genesis’s digital transformation?</p>

  <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>[Victor Viola]</strong><br>
  AI is still on the horizon for us, but it’s something we’re actively exploring. With Siemens’s guidance, we’re looking at use cases like automated DFM feedback, machine utilization forecasting, and smart quoting. But we’re moving carefully—our value is in custom, high-touch engineering, so anything we automate has to respect that foundation.</p>

  <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>[Kavita Menon]</strong><br>
  What should customers expect to see next?</p>

  <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>[Victor Viola]</strong><br>
  More transparency, faster alignment, and better design outcomes—especially in regulated sectors like medical devices. Simulation is a tool, not a shortcut. We’re building the internal knowledge and partnerships now so that when we apply it, we’re doing so with the same rigor and reliability that our customers expect from Genesis.</p>`

  Great question, Joan. Over the last year, we’ve invested in internal ROI modeling platforms that simulate outcomes like material savings, production throughput, and cost avoidance. These models are built with real manufacturing data, so they reflect what’s actually achievable on our floor. In one recent aerospace engagement, for instance, we helped a client transition to a new material strategy that’s expected to reduce their annual operational costs by 12%. That wasn’t just a win for engineering—it gave our sales team a compelling financial story to anchor the proposal.</p>

  <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>[Joan Wayne]</strong><br>
  So these financial models go beyond internal planning—they’re actually changing the customer conversation?</p>

  <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>[Victor Viola – Global VP of Strategic Sales]</strong><br>
  Absolutely. Aerospace clients today are incredibly data-driven. Their procurement teams are evaluating long-term ownership costs, regulatory risks, and program sustainability—not just unit pricing. When we walk in with scenario-based forecasts and can show how a design decision affects their bottom line, it shifts the relationship. We’re not just a supplier anymore—we’re a financial partner.</p>

  <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>[Joan Wayne]</strong><br>
  What are aerospace clients demanding in this high-pressure environment?</p>

  <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>[Brian Matthews]</strong><br>
  Two things: transparency and speed. They want to see clear projections of how our solution will impact key financial metrics like EBITDA or program-level ROI—and they want that insight before a contract is signed. That’s why we’ve built tools that link engineering inputs to financial outcomes, and why our teams are trained to speak both technical and financial languages fluently.</p>

  <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>[Joan Wayne]</strong><br>
  So this isn't just about pricing—it’s about delivering strategic value.</p>

  <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>[Victor Viola]</strong><br>
  Exactly. Our job is to help clients justify the investment. Whether it’s a new process that reduces waste or a reengineered assembly that accelerates time-to-certification, we’re proving that Genesis can be a driver of margin—not just a cost center. In aerospace, that’s the difference between being a vendor and being a long-term partner.</p>

  <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>[Joan Wayne]</strong><br>
  Thanks, Brian and Victor. It’s clear that embedding financial thinking into every stage of the customer journey is helping Genesis stand out in a highly competitive sector.</p>`

  Stacy, thanks for joining us. You’ve been at the forefront of Genesis’s initiative to modernize technical demonstrations. What’s resonating most with clients about our AI-driven demo approach?</p>

  <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>[Stacy Tracy – Senior Fellow Design Engineer]</strong><br>
  Thanks, Alyssa. What clients value most is realism. They’re no longer satisfied with generic overviews—they want to see how our solutions behave under their specific conditions, before a prototype is even made. With AI-powered modeling, we can simulate their exact use case in real time. For example, in a recent aerospace engagement, we built a digital twin of a fuel valve system and ran stress simulations live in the meeting. That level of contextual, on-demand insight builds credibility fast.</p>

  <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>[Alyssa Chen]</strong><br>
  So it’s less about polish and more about practical validation?</p>

  <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>[Stacy Tracy]</strong><br>
  Exactly. These aren’t just animations—they’re dynamic simulations driven by real data. We ingest variables from prior programs, adjust to the client’s specs, and use AI to run performance and risk scenarios. Clients can adjust parameters on the spot—change materials, simulate failures, or view lifecycle cost impacts. It’s collaborative, predictive engineering that brings them into the process early.</p>

  <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>[Alyssa Chen]</strong><br>
  What’s been the biggest challenge in making these demos scalable?</p>

  <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>[Stacy Tracy]</strong><br>
  Integration. For these models to reflect real-world conditions, they need clean, synchronized inputs from across our systems—design, compliance, procurement, supply chain. Over the past year, we’ve built backend tooling that connects our PLM and ERP environments, so the AI demos pull live, validated data. But there’s still work to be done to ensure standardization across global teams and project types.</p>

  <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>[Alyssa Chen]</strong><br>
  And looking ahead, what excites you most about where this capability is heading?</p>

  <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>[Stacy Tracy]</strong><br>
  We’re evolving demos into real-time design environments. Clients can bring a concept to the table, and we can explore it together—adjusting dimensions, tolerances, regulatory constraints, even projected manufacturing costs. It shifts the dynamic from presentation to co-creation. That’s what makes partnerships stick—we're solving problems together from day one.</p>

  <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>[Alyssa Chen]</strong><br>
  That’s a powerful shift. Stacy, thank you for sharing where this innovation is taking us next.</p>`
