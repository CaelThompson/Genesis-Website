The plan, set to unfold over the next five years, includes the addition of two state-of-the-art terminals, an automated baggage system, a high-speed transit loop, and a new sustainability-focused cargo wing.</p>

  <h2 style="font-size: 2rem; margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Growth Driven by Demand</h2>

  <p style=";; margin-bottom: 1rem;">The expansion follows a 38% increase in passenger volume since 2021, with projections indicating over 27 million travelers will pass through Skyport annually by 2027. The airport, currently operating near capacity, hopes to alleviate congestion and improve traveler experience.</p>

  <p style=";; margin-bottom: 1rem;">“This is not just a response to growth — it’s an investment in the future of regional air travel,” said Skyport CEO Tasha Lin at Tuesday’s announcement. “We are building an airport worthy of the next generation.”</p>

  <h2 style="font-size: 2rem; margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Community Response and Environmental Review</h2>

  <p style=";; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Community leaders have largely supported the plan, citing job creation and increased tourism revenue. However, local environmental organizations have raised concerns about air quality, light pollution, and increased carbon output from larger operations.</p>

  <p style=";; margin-bottom: 1rem;">“This project could be transformative,” said Councilmember Jorge Valdez. “But it must be held to strict environmental accountability.” A formal environmental impact report is due by November, and construction will not begin until early 2024 pending approval.</p>

  <p style=";; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Skyport has promised electric vehicle support, a LEED Platinum terminal, and a rooftop greenhouse as part of its green design initiative. Despite some skepticism, public surveys show 62% of residents in favor of the project.</p>`

    content: `<p style=";; margin-bottom: 1rem;">A once-abandoned textile mill on the eastern edge of Milltown has become the unlikely center of a cultural revival, thanks to a grassroots artist collective known as Inkforge. Over the past two years, the collective has painstakingly converted the crumbling brick structure into a multi-use arts and community space — complete with open studios, rotating exhibits, and educational programming.</p>

  <h2 style="font-size: 2rem; margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">From Ruin to Renaissance</h2>

  <p style=";; margin-bottom: 1rem;">The mill, originally constructed in 1891 and left derelict since 2004, was slated for demolition until Inkforge proposed an alternative vision: a self-sustaining creative ecosystem. Using a combination of crowdfunding, local grants, and volunteer labor, they restored over 45,000 square feet of space—preserving much of the original brickwork and timber beams.</p>

  <p style=";; margin-bottom: 1rem;">“We didn’t want to erase the past,” said co-founder Marissa Phan. “We wanted to layer onto it — make something new without losing what was here.”</p>

  <h2 style="font-size: 2rem; margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Art for Everyone</h2>

  <p style=";; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Today, Inkforge is home to more than 20 resident artists working in mediums ranging from sculpture and fiber art to digital design and AI-generated installations. Weekly open studio nights invite the public to engage with the artists, view works in progress, and purchase pieces directly.</p>

  <p style=";; margin-bottom: 1rem;">The collective also hosts monthly gallery openings, live mural events, and after-school programs for youth. Community workshops on printmaking, ceramics, and 3D modeling have consistently sold out since summer.</p>

  <h2 style="font-size: 2rem; margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">An Engine for Local Growth</h2>

  <p style=";; margin-bottom: 1rem;">The neighborhood around Inkforge is already beginning to change. Small cafés, bike repair shops, and cooperative bookstores have begun to open nearby, drawn by the renewed energy and foot traffic the collective generates. City officials are now considering additional zoning support for creative redevelopment.</p>

  <p style=";; margin-bottom: 1rem;">“This isn’t just about art,” said councilmember Priya Leung. “It’s about identity, opportunity, and transformation. Inkforge is a catalyst.”</p>

  <p style=";; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Looking ahead, Inkforge plans to partner with nearby colleges for a shared artist-in-residence program, and is in talks to develop a satellite space focused on performance art and theater. “We’re just getting started,” said Phan. “This is the blueprint for what’s possible when art and community move together.”</p>`

    <h2 style="font-size: 2rem; margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Laying the Foundation for Digital Twin Capabilities</h2>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">While Genesis does not yet have full digital twin modeling of its shop floor, internal planning efforts are focused on developing a virtual environment that could eventually replicate factory workflows, test customization scenarios, and model real-time system behavior. Such a platform would allow users to visualize energy consumption patterns, stress-test machine diagnostics, and better understand how integrated automation responds to disruptions or design changes.</p>

    <h2 style="font-size: 2rem; margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">A Long-Term Vision for VR and Simulation</h2>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">“This is a longer-term objective, not something we currently offer,” says Elizabeth Redding, CTO. “But as clients demand more visibility and predictability in system performance, tools like VR-based modeling and digital twin technology will help us deliver that experience before the first bolt is turned.”</p>

    <h2 style="font-size: 2rem; margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Strategic Partnerships as Enablers</h2>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">Any future rollout would likely depend on external partnerships, particularly with industrial software providers like Siemens. Early-stage discussions have focused on how such collaboration could accelerate Genesis’s ability to simulate end-to-end line behavior and provide clients with a deeper level of assurance during the decision-making process.</p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">“This digital enablement concept is part of a broader effort by Genesis to evolve its customer engagement model. As manufacturing moves toward smarter, data-driven systems, Genesis aims to position itself as a forward-looking integrator—committed not only to building advanced hardware, but to delivering greater transparency and insight into how that hardware performs over time.”</p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">With manufacturing and design houses located across North America, Europe, and Asia, Genesis has been able to enter and grow in multiple regions by leveraging close partnerships, localized production capabilities, and a responsive global supply chain. This global presence allows Genesis to offer both agility and proximity—two factors increasingly critical in today’s dynamic industrial landscape.</p>

    <h2 style="font-size: 2rem; margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Regional Focus, Industry Expertise</h2>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">To better align with customer needs, Genesis divides its sales organization by both region and industry vertical. Each territory is supported by sales teams who specialize in that region’s unique business climate and technical requirements—whether that’s aerospace in North America, automotive in Europe, or medical manufacturing in Southeast Asia.</p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">What sets Genesis sales reps apart is their deep industry experience and technical fluency. Many team members come from engineering or manufacturing backgrounds and are able to speak fluently about Genesis’s full range of capabilities—from automation integration to system design.</p>
    
    <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">“We hire people who not only understand sales, but who truly understand how our solutions are built and delivered,” says Victor Viola, Global VP of Strategic Accounts. “That means they can sit down with a customer’s engineering team and actually solve problems.” </p>
    
    <h2 style="font-size: 2rem; margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Leveraging Internal Tools to Stay Ahead</h2>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">“To support this expertise, Genesis equips its account teams with tools like its internal ROI Visualization Platform—a behind-the-scenes financial modeling engine that helps prioritize opportunities and sharpen strategy. While not customer-facing, it gives sales leaders insight into where Genesis creates the most long-term economic value and where to focus resources.”</p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">The platform also features a “Green ROI” layer, which tracks carbon savings across different solution scenarios, helping sales teams better understand the sustainability impact of each engagement—an increasingly relevant factor in today's procurement decisions.</p>
    
    <h2 style="font-size: 2rem; margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Preparing for More Complex Products</h2>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">As Genesis’s systems grow more advanced—particularly in software-defined manufacturing and AI-enabled automation—the sales process is becoming more technically demanding. Recognizing this, the company is investing in training, tools, and internal collaboration to ensure sales reps stay ahead of evolving product capabilities.</p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">“The future of selling industrial solutions isn’t just about features,” Viola adds. “It’s about being able to translate deep technical capability into business outcomes. That’s where Genesis is heading—and how we plan to lead.”</p>
