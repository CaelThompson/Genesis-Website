It’s incredibly fulfilling to see the positive impact our products have on their operations, and to know that we’ve played a role in helping them achieve their goals.</p>

    Alan, how do you envision the future of sales at Genesis?</p>

    Looking ahead, I believe the future of sales will continue to rely on deep relationships and personalized solutions. But technology is also going to play a bigger role in how we engage with customers. Virtual and augmented reality will allow us to demonstrate products in more interactive ways, and AI-driven analytics will help us predict customer needs even before they express them. It’s about staying ahead of the curve while maintaining that personal touch.</p>
